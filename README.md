## Usage

### Command-Line Usage

Run the script with the following command:
```bash
python blogtoepub.py <URL> [options]
```

#### Positional Argument:
- `URL`: The URL of the blog page containing links to articles.

#### Optional Arguments:
- `--title, -t`: Custom title for the epub (default: derived from the blog's name).
- `--cover, -c`: Path to a custom cover image (default: `./covers/red.png`).
- `--no-add-cover-text`: Disable adding title and URL text to the cover image.

#### Example:

## Algorithms and Key Features

### Link Detection Algorithm
To extract blog post links from a page, we employ the **largest repeating subtree** algorithm:

1. **Node Representation**:
   Each HTML element is represented as a `Node`, which includes:
   - The element's tag and attributes.
   - A hash representing its structure.
   - A list of its children.

2. **Subtree Hashing**:
   Each node computes a hash that includes:
   - Its tag name.
   - A sorted list of its attributes.
   - The hashes of its child nodes.

3. **Subtree Size Analysis**:
   Subtrees are counted based on their hashes. The largest repeating subtree typically corresponds to the main content of the page, such as blog post links.

4. **Filtering Links**:
   Links within the detected subtree are cleaned and filtered to remove duplicates, images, and invalid URLs.

### UI for Link Selection
The program uses PyQt5 to provide an interactive UI:
- **Exclude Selected**: Removes unwanted links.
- **Reverse Order**: Changes the order of links for custom sequencing.
- **Submit**: Finalizes your selection.

### Cover Customization
Covers are generated using PIL with optional text overlays. The program automatically wraps and fits the text into the image, ensuring a professional appearance.

## Output
- epub files are saved in the `output/` directory.
- The file name is derived from the title (spaces replaced with underscores).
